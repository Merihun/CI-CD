# CI/CD
- is the acronym for the combined practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). 
- are currently the most widely accepted choice to shorten software development and delivery cycle time.
- creates a fast and effective process of getting your product to market before your competition as well as releasing new features and bug fixes to keep your current customers happy.

Continuous Integration (CI) 
- allows you to continuously integrate code into a single shared and easy to access repository. 

Continuous Delivery (CD) 
- allows you to take the code stored in the repository and continuously deliver it to production.
